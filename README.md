### Hi, salut, servus, hola, ahoj! ðŸ‘‹

I am a sociologist at the Charles University with a focus on political communication, recently finished my research stay at the Deparment of Communication at the University of Vienna. I am interested in how computational tools, such as Natural Language Processing, could benefit social science in particular, and, more generally, the development of a healthy democratic society at large. Besides conducting research and implementing data science solutions, I am passionate about teaching, language learning and knowledge sharing.

ðŸ”­ Experience:
- Languages: R & Python, operational knowledge of Bash, JS, Julia & SQL.
- NLP & Linguistic methods: named entity recognition, collocations & concordances, word embeddings, sentiment analysis (lexicon & BERT model), semantic analysis (UCREL & UDPIPE features), LDA topic modeling, KW extraction, document similarity (doc2vec).
- Statistical methods: sequence analysis, regression modeling, factor analysis, SEM (lavaan), clustering.
- APIs: Postman.
- Database software: DBeaver, Google BigQuery.
- Development environments: RStudio, VS Code.
- Cloud computing: Google Cloud Platform, Jupyter-based environments (Kaggle, Deepnote, Google Colab, SageMaker Lab), Keboola.
- Deployement & automation: Netflify, GitHub Actions.
- Containerization tools: Docker.
- BI tools: Power BI, Tableau. 

ðŸŒ± Interested in:
- End-to-end open source data solutions.
- Applications of NLP & ML on political discourse corpora. 
- Building automatic data pipelines.
- Advanced data analysis and visualizations.

ðŸ‘¯ Projects:
- Computational analysis of Czech media discourse on migration since 2015.
- Transparency International: Several solutions for automated data extraction and analysis of social media data in the context of the 2021 Czech parliamentary elections monitoring.
- Contributed to Facebook's [Radlibrary](https://github.com/facebookresearch) package, which provides a high-level interface for FB Ad Library API in R.
- Covid pandemic, psychological health, and media sources: Analysis of an international survey dataset from the "Pandemic Emergency in Social Perspective" project.
- Other projects: NLP analysis of interview transcripts with Holocaust survivors, Web App to aid non-native Czech speakers with syntax using existing models (Deepl, Lindat) with translation into auxiliary language back into Czech.
- [Chapter](https://bookdown.org/paul/apis_for_social_scientists/facebook-ad-library-api.html) in the open-source book *APIs for social scientists* on the usage of Facebook Ad Library API.

ðŸ¤” I am looking for collaboration on:
- Exploring the feasibility of Transformer models (BERT/[CZERT](https://github.com/kiv-air/Czert)/[Slavic BERT](https://github.com/deepmipt/Slavic-BERT-NER)) for NLP tasks on Czech (social) media corpus.
- Object classification and visual sentiment analysis of social media images.
- Finalization of my code into standalone R libraries (or PL improvements of original packages) so they could benefit others.
