### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a sociologist at the Charles University with a focus on political communication, currently doing my research stay at the Deparment of Communication at the University of Vienna. I am also interested in how technology tools, such as NLP, big data analysis, and machine learning could benefit social science in particular, and, more generally, the development of a healthy democratic society at large. Besides conducting research and implementing data science solutions, I am passionate about teaching and knowledge sharing.

ðŸ”­ Experience:
- Languages: R (advanced), Python (intermediate), SQL (intermediate), Julia (fundamentals), Bash (fundamentals).
- Statistics: Regression modeling, Factor analysis, Structural Equation Modeling (lavaan), Clustering.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions.
- Containerization tools: Docker.
- Cloud & Big Data: Google Cloud Platform, Keboola, Spark.
- BI tools: Google Data Studio, Power BI, Tableau. 

ðŸŒ± Interested in:
- End-to-end open source data solutions.
- Applications of NLP & ML on political discourse corpora. 
- Building automatic data pipelines.
- Advanced data analysis and visualizations.

ðŸ‘¯ I am currently working on:
- Computational analysis of Czech media discourse on migration since 2015.
- Transparency International: Several solutions for automated data extraction and analysis of social media data in the context of the 2021 Czech parliamentary elections monitoring.
- Covid pandemic, psychological health, and media sources: Analysis of an international survey dataset from the "Pandemic Emergency in Social Perspective" project.
- Other projects: NLP analysis of interview transcripts with Holocaust survivors, Web App to aid non-native Czech speakers with syntax using existing models (Deepl, Lindat) with translation into auxiliary language back into Czech.
- Contributing to the *APIs for social scientists* book with a [chapter](https://bookdown.org/paul/apis_for_social_scientists/) on the usage of Facebook Ad Library API.

ðŸ¤” I am looking for collaboration on:
- Exploring the feasibility of Transformer models (BERT/[CZERT](https://github.com/kiv-air/Czert)/[Slavic BERT](https://github.com/deepmipt/Slavic-BERT-NER)) for NLP tasks on Czech (social) media corpus.
- Object classification and visual sentiment analysis of social media images.
- Finalization of my code into standalone R libraries (or PL improvements of original packages) so they could benefit others.
