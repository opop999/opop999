### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a sociologist at the Charles University with a focus on political communication. I am also interested in how technology tools, such as NLP, big data analysis, and machine learning could benefit social science in particular, and, more generally, the development of a healthy democratic society at large. Besides conducting research and implementing data science solutions, I am passionate about teaching and knowledge sharing.

ðŸ”­ Experience:
- Languages: R (advanced), SQL (intermediate), Python, (fundamentals), Bash (fundamentals)
- Statistics: Regression modeling, Factor analysis, Structural Equation Modeling (lavaan)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Containerization tools: Docker
- Cloud & Big Data: Google Cloud Platform, Keboola, Spark
- BI tools: Google Data Studio, Power BI, Tableau 

ðŸŒ± Interested in:
- End-to-end open source data solutions
- Building automatic data pipelines
- Advanced data analysis and visualizations
- Applications of NLP & ML on political discourse 

ðŸ‘¯ I am currently working on:
- Transparency International: Several solutions for automated data extraction and analysis in the context of the 2021 Czech parliamentary elections monitoring
- Covid pandemic, psychological health, and media sources: Analysis of an international survey dataset from the "Pandemic Emergency in Social Perspective" project
- Personal projects: Automated quantitative analysis of Czech political discourse on migration, NLP analysis of interview transcripts with Holocaust survivors, Web App to aid non-native Czech speakers with syntax using existing models (Deepl, Lindat) with translation into auxiliary language back into Czech.

ðŸ¤” I am looking for help with:
- Experimenting with Transformer models (BERT/[CZERT](https://github.com/kiv-air/Czert)/[Slavic BERT](https://github.com/deepmipt/Slavic-BERT-NER) - for NLP tasks on Czech (social) media corpus. 
- Finalization of my code into standalone R libraries (or PL improvements) so they could benefit others
